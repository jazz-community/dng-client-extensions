# dng-client-extensions
Within this project we develop and share DNG (Doors Next Generation) Client Extensions.

## Overview
Starting in version 4.0.5 of the Requirements Management (RM) application, you can use a new client extension capability to add additional functionality for requirements management.

You can add the extensions to your mini dashboard and remove them as needed. Extensions are authored by using a combination of JavaScript, XML/HTML, and CSS files. The extensions access data within the RM application by using an RM API.
